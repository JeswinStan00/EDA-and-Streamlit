ðŸ“– Overview

The Titanic sank in 1912, taking over 1500 lives.
This project predicts whether a passenger survived based on:

Passenger class

Gender

Age

Family size

Fare paid

Port of embarkation

ðŸ“Š Dataset

We use the Kaggle Titanic dataset:


Feature	Description
Survived	0 = No, 1 = Yes
Pclass	Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Sex	Gender
Age	Passenger age
SibSp	Siblings/spouses aboard
Parch	Parents/children aboard
Fare	Ticket price
Embarked	Port of embarkation

Steps:

Data Cleaning â€“ Handle missing values & inconsistent data.

Feature Engineering â€“ Encode categorical variables, create new features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualize survival trends.

Model Training â€“ Random Forest Classifier with cross-validation.

Evaluation â€“ Accuracy score & confusion matrix.

Deployment â€“ Streamlit web app.
